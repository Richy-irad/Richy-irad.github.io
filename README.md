This repository was meant just to showcase a few of my skills with chosen technologies.

The First project in the repository is the Color Game(RGB color guessing game), which can be interacted with from [here](https://richy-irad.github.io/ColorGame)/ColorGame.html. Click the square with the color you think matches the color in the title. If you get it wrong you get to choose another, if right, all the squares will turn to the correct color. You will then have to play again or just close the tab to exit. you can also play in two modes, one easy and the other Hard. Check them out
